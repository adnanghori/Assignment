/*8. A cyclist coasting on a level road slows from a speed of 10mi/hr to 2.5mi/hr in one minute .write a c program that calculates the cyclist’s constant rate of acceleration and determine how long the cyclist will take to come rest ,given an initial speed of 10mi/hr.(hint use a=(vf – vi)/t    where a is acceleration ,t time interval vi initial velocity and vf is the final velocity).
